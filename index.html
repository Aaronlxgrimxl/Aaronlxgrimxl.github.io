        <h1> <br>I come from </h1>
        <h2>By Aaron Harris</h2>
        <h3> <strong>I come from</strong> <br>a place where all you take in is lies.
A place that would make kids cry.

         A place where insanity feeds
and constructed hope brethes.

to the whimpers of tears.

to the silence of fears.</h3>

<h4>Don't get me wrong; I'm used to thinking people care.

But when true intentions peek out, the psychotic break takes over in the form of a blink stair.

I care about you, or even I love you—just words that are lighter than dust.

said out loud because someone wants something, but after you give it up, it's gone by dusk.</h4>

<h5> I come from<br> a place that used to mean something great. But sooner or later, I learned that it was a façade that I made to feel good about my fate.

I tried to carboncopy happiness, but it was too late.

    You only get one shot at life. So don't think about a clean slate.</h5>

<h6><strong>I come from</strong><br> a place where love is and will always be a concept.
Our hearts were just buckets filled with fake words and content.


If only they gave us the same intent we gave them, then the store wouldn't have to end with revenge.</h6>
